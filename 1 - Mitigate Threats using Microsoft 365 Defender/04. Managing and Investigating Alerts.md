# Managing and Investigating Alerts

## Alert Management

- alerts can be managed by selecting an alert in the Alerts queue or the Alerts tab of the device page for an individual device. 
- metadata and actions shown in the Alert preview page include
	- Severity - *High/Medium/Low/Informational*
	- Categories - MITRE ATT&CK matrix alignment. 
	- Link to another incident - create a new incident from alert or link to an existing incident
	- Assign alerts - assign alert to analyst
	- Suppress alerts - suppress alerts from appearing in Microsoft Defender Security Center.
	- Change status of alert - categorize as *New/In Progress/Resolved* 
	- Alert classification - specify whether an alert is a true alert or a false alert.
	- add comments and view history of alert.

- Microsoft Defender AV and Defender for Endpoint alert severities are different in scope.
- Defender AV represents absolute severity of the malware detected
- MDE represents severity of detected behaviour, actual risk to device, and organizational context.
- When a suppression rule is created, it will take effect from the point when the rule is created.
- Suppression rules don't affect alerts that already in the queue prior to rule creation. 

## Alert Investigation

- Alerts can be investigating by selecting the alert and going to the alert page.
- the alerts page contain alert title, affected assets, details of alert, and alert story.

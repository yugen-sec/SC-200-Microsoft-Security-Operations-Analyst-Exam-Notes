# Microsoft 365 Defender

## Introduction 

- integrated threat protection suite with solutions that detect malicious activity across **email, endpoints, applications, and identity**. 
- a unified pre- and post-breach enterprise defense suite.
- comprises of 
	1. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
	2. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO)
	3. Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI)
	4. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps(MDC)
	5. Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management 

- this is Microsoft's XDR solution

**Example XDR scenario**
1. Victim receives a malicious email on personal email account (not protected by MDO)
2. User opens attachment and malware infects the endpoint
3. User is unaware of malware
4. MDE detects attack, raises alert to security operations
5. MDE communicates to Intune about risk level change of endpoint
6. Intune marks account in Azure AD as non-compliant 
7. Conditional Access blocks user access to corporate resources
8. MDE remediates threat (automated/manual/both)
9. MDE shares telemetry across organization and remediate any other affected endpoints
10. MDE shares information on attack to Microsoft Threat Intelligence (MTI) system to protect other MDE customers.
11. After remediation of threat, MDE signals Intune about change in risk level of endpoint
12. Azure AD Conditional Access then restores access to corporate resources
13. Threat Intel shared to MTI is used by other tools (MDO, Microsoft Defender for Cloud etc.) to detect and remediate threats in email, office collaboration, Azure, and more.

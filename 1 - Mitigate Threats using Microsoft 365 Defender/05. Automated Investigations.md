# Managing Automated Investigations

## Automated Investigation and Remediation Technology (AIR)

- Sec ops teams face challenges in addressing the countless alerts that come from a never-ending flow of threats. 
- to address this MDE uses AIR (Automated Investigation and Remediation) technology. This reduces alert volume 
- AIR uses various inspection algorithms and is based on processes used by human analysts. 
- The Action centre keeps detailed track of all the investigations that were initiated automatically.

## How it Works

- when an alert is triggered, a security play-book goes into effect.
- depending on the play-book, an automated investigation initiates.
- While an investigation is running, any other alerts generated from the device are added to an ongoing automated investigation until that investigation is completed.
- if the same threat is seen on other devices, they are also added to the investigation, and security play-books kick off (scope of automated incident is expanded).
- if ten or more devices are found during this expansion process from the same entity, then that expansion action requires approval and is visible on the Pending actions tab.

## Automated Threat Remediation

- a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated in the incident
- Verdicts can be *Malicious*, *Suspicious*, or *No threats found*.
- once verdicts are reached, automated remediation actions are carried out.
-example for remediation actions are sending file to quarantine, stopping a service, removing scheduled tasks etc.
- Depending on the level of automation set for your organization, and other security settings, remediation actions can occur automatically or only upon approval by your security operations team

## Levels of Automation

| **Automation Level**                         | **Description**                                                                                             | **Notes**                                                                                                                             |

| Semi (require approval for core folders)     | require approval for remediation actions needed on files or .exes in core folders                           | - core folders include OS directories such as "\Windows\* directory - pending actions can be viewed and approved in the Action Centre |
| Semi (require approval for non-temp folders) | approval is required for any remediation actions needed on files or .exes that aren't in temporary folders. | - remediation actions can be taken automatically on files or executables that are in temporary folders                                |
